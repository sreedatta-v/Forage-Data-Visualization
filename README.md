## Background Information: 
The digital revolution and our fast-changing world require a skills revolution. And it’s not just about the digital skills. The skills revolution is about helping people build their digital awareness, emotional intelligence, and creativity to fully participate in the digital future workplace — and it needs to start now.

At PwC, we are working with other organizations across the world, building on our work with clients and on upskilling our 276,000 people. Still, more must be done if we are to ensure everyone has the opportunity to learn, work, and participate in the digital world. This is at the heart of our purpose.

We are enabling employees who are motivated to further accelerate their skills to do so by offering them a “career pivot” to become what we call “Digital Accelerators”. Accelerators rapidly deepen their skills in digital specialties, such as data, automation, AI, and digital storytelling by learning a variety of self-service tools and coding languages and applying these skills across our business.

We're happy you joined us, welcome to the team! Giulia is your manager and helps you through your upskilling journey in PowerBI - your step to becoming a true data Jedi and Digital Accelerator. But wait no more, word spreads fast and an important client reached out to you to help him visualize their data. 

### About Company:

Managers were eager to determine what the customer wanted.<i><b> Total number of calls answered and abandoned, speed of answer, length of calls, overall customer satisfaction, etc.  </b></i>

What they want after is an accurate overview of long-term trends in <b><i>customer and agent behavior.</b></i>

### Key performance indicators:
Possible KPIs include (to get you started, but not limited to):

• Overall customer satisfaction  
• Overall calls answered/abandoned  
• Calls by time  
• Average speed of answer  
• Agent’s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered

## Task2 

### Task to do:  

1. Create a dashboard using the defined KPIs to reflect customer demographics and insights.  

2. Write a concise email to the engagement partner explaining your findings and providing suggestions for necessary changes based on the dashboard you've created.  

### Background information  

A few weeks after presenting your dashboard to the management, the Retention Manager from the telecom reaches out to you directly. He was impressed by your work and asked if you can put together a dashboard about customer retention.  

In addition, to better understand the data, the telecom Retention Manager has scheduled a meeting with the engagement partner at PwC to cover these points: 

• Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don’t want to lose them.  
• The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination.  
• Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk.   
• We  have done customer analysis with Excel: but it has always ended in a dead-end.   
• We would like to know more about our customers: visualized clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management.   

The Retentions Manager has provided some information in the resources.

## Task 3

1. Create visualizations to represent HR data, particularly focusing on gender-related KPIs.  

2. Identify and discuss potential root causes for the slow progress in achieving gender balance at the executive management level.  

Human Resources at our telecom client is highly into diversity and inclusion. They’ve been working hard to improve gender balance at the executive management level, but they’re not seeing any progress. They’re reaching out to us for help.

At PwC Switzerland we are often approached by clients seeking support with diversity and inclusion. Companies need a workforce of diverse talents and backgrounds to succeed in an increasingly complex and heterogeneous world. To us, diversity and inclusion are business imperatives, not just nice-to-haves. We aim for all of our teams to feel welcome and appreciated. But achieving this and unlocking its potential involves a whole set of practical challenges.

<b> Why is this so? </b>

Consider the importance of strategy, awareness and education, analytics and inspiration. 

Here is a hint: Calculating the following measures could help to define proper KPIs:

<code>#of men</code>  
<code>#of women</code>   
<code>#of leavers</code>   
<code>%employees promoted (FY21)</code>   
<code>%of women promoted</code>   
<code>%of hires men</code>   
<code>%of hires women</code>   
<code>%turnover</code>   
<code>Average performance rating: men</code>   
<code>Average Performance rating: women</code>  

### Your task is to do the following:

1. Create visualizations to represent HR data, particularly focusing on gender-related KPIs.
2. Identify and discuss potential root causes for the slow progress in achieving gender balance at the executive management level.
